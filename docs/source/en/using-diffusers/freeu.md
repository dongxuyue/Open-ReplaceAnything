# Improve generation quality with FreeU

[[open-in-colab]]

The UNet is responsible for denoising during the reverse diffusion process, and there are two distinct features in its architecture:

1. Backbone features primarily contribute to the denoising process
2. Skip features mainly introduce high-frequency features into the decoder module and can make the network overlook the semantics in the backbone features

However, the skip connection can sometimes introduce unnatural image details. [FreeU](https://hf.co/papers/2309.11497) is a technique for improving image quality by rebalancing the contributions from the UNetâ€™s skip connections and backbone feature maps.

FreeU is applied during inference and it does not require any additional training. The technique works for different tasks such as text-to-image, image-to-image, and text-to-video.

In this guide, you will apply FreeU to the [`StableDiffusionPipeline`], [`StableDiffusionXLPipeline`], and [`TextToVideoSDPipeline`]. You need to install Diffusers from source to run the examples below.

## StableDiffusionPipeline

Load the pipeline:

```py
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16, safety_checker=None
).to("cuda")
```

Then enable the FreeU mechanism with the FreeU-specific hyperparameters. These values are scaling factors for the backbone and skip features.

```py
pipeline.enable_freeu(s1=0.9, s2=0.2, b1=1.2, b2=1.4)
```

The values above are from the official FreeU [code repository](https://github.com/ChenyangSi/FreeU) where you can also find [reference hyperparameters](https://github.com/ChenyangSi/FreeU#range-for-more-parameters) for different models.

<Tip>

Disable the FreeU mechanism by calling `disable_freeu()` on a pipeline.

</Tip>

And then run inference:

```py
prompt = "A squirrel eating a burger"
seed = 2023
image = pipeline(prompt, generator=torch.manual_seed(seed)).images[0]
image
```

The figure below compares non-FreeU and FreeU results respectively for the same hyperparameters used above (`prompt` and `seed`):

Let's see how Stable Diffusion 2 results are impacted:

```py
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1", torch_dtype=torch.float16, safety_checker=None
).to("cuda")

prompt = "A squirrel eating a burger"
seed = 2023

pipeline.enable_freeu(s1=0.9, s2=0.2, b1=1.1, b2=1.2)
image = pipeline(prompt, generator=torch.manual_seed(seed)).images[0]
image
```

## Stable Diffusion XL

Finally, let's take a look at how FreeU affects Stable Diffusion XL results:

```py
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", torch_dtype=torch.float16,
).to("cuda")

prompt = "A squirrel eating a burger"
seed = 2023

# Comes from
# https://wandb.ai/nasirk24/UNET-FreeU-SDXL/reports/FreeU-SDXL-Optimal-Parameters--Vmlldzo1NDg4NTUw
pipeline.enable_freeu(s1=0.6, s2=0.4, b1=1.1, b2=1.2)
image = pipeline(prompt, generator=torch.manual_seed(seed)).images[0]
image
```

## Text-to-video generation

FreeU can also be used to improve video quality:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
import torch

model_id = "cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w"
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")

prompt = "an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
seed = 2023

# The values come from
# https://github.com/lyn-rgb/FreeU_Diffusers#video-pipelines
pipe.enable_freeu(b1=1.2, b2=1.4, s1=0.9, s2=0.2)
video_frames = pipe(prompt, height=320, width=576, num_frames=30, generator=torch.manual_seed(seed)).frames[0]
export_to_video(video_frames, "astronaut_rides_horse.mp4")
```
